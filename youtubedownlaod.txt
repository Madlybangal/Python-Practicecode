#Progressive download is a technique used to stream media from a web server to a client such as a video player on a laptop or mobile phone.
#Without progressive download, a client has to download the entire media file before video playback can start.
#There are two major problems with progressive streaming.
#The first is quality. Avideo that is only 1280 X 720 will never play at correct quality level on a screen that is 1920 X 1080 px.
#It will be stretched and you'll sea pixealation.
#The second is buffering. If the user has a low quality internet connection and cannot download video streamfast enough, video will
#need to pause, wait for more data and start again. This is very common, especially on mobile devices, where the connection can vary
#greatly depending on user's location.
#Adaptive bitrate streaming(aka adaptive streaming) is a technology designed to deliver video in the most efficient way possible.
#and in the highest usable quality for each specified user and device.
#For example, if a small video can be downloaded faster than a large video and user has a slow internet connection, an adaptive video stream7
#will switch to smaller video file sizes to keep video playing
