#Class methods are methods that are called on the class itself, not on a specific object instance.
# The class method can be called using ClassName.method_name() as well as by using an object of the class.

# You can use class methods for any methods that are not bound to a specific instance but the class. 
# In practice, you often use class methods for methods that create an instance of the class.
# When a method creates an instance of the class and returns it, the method is called a factory method.
