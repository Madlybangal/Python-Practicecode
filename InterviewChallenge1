#To complete this challenge, write a function that accepts a number as a parameter. 
#The function should return a number thatâ€™s the difference between the largest and 
# smallest numbers that the digits can form in the number.
#For example, if the parameter is "213", the function should return "198", 
#which is the result of 123 subtracted from 321.

    #The join() method takes all items in an iterable and joins them into one string.
    #A string must be specified as the separator.

    numberb=''.join(sorted(number,reverse=True))
