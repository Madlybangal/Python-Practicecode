#  Resampling in python Pandas
# Resample Time Series Data Using Pandas To Enhance Analysis
# So, if one needs to change the data instead of daily to monthly or weekly etc. or vice versa,
# we need to do resampling.
# Downsampling Decreases frequency like from second to hour  
# Upsampling increases frequency from Month to day,hour to second
# Set index to Timeseries Data
# Upsample with interpolation
# Downsample with aggregation
import pandas as pd
import seaborn as sns

#print(sp.head())
# Upsampling
#print(sp[['price']].resample('H').ffill())
#Downsampling
avg_month=sp[['price']].resample('M').mean()
