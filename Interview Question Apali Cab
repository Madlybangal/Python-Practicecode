Problem statement: Aapali Taxi is a taxi cab operator. They have 3 types of cars- Mini, Sedan and SUV, each with different tariffs. When customers approach them for 
booking rides, they show an “Estimated Cost” for the passengers based on various parameters. 
Mini ● Base charges flat up to 3 KM- Rs. 50 
● For the next 15 KM- Rs. 10 per KM 
● Additional distance charged at Rs. 8 per KM 
● If the total ride distance is more than 75 KM, the ride is charged at Rs. 8 per KM flat with no base charges Sedan 
● Base charges flat up to 5 KM- Rs. 80 
● For the next 15 KM- Rs. 12 per KM 
● Additional distance charged at Rs. 10 per KM 
● If the total ride distance is more than 100 KM, the ride charged at Rs. 10 per KM flat with no base charges SUV 
● Base charges flat up to 5 KM- Rs. 100 
● For the next 15 KM- Rs. 15 per KM 
● Every additional KM- Rs. 12 per KM 
● No flat charges, pay as per tariff above Sample scenarios: Input: 10 KM Expected Output: Mini - Rs. 120, Sedan - Rs. 140, 
SUV - Rs. 175 Input: 20 km Expected Output: Mini - Rs. 216, Sedan - Rs. 260, SUV - Rs. 325 Input: 80 km Expected Output: Mini - Rs. 640, 
Sedan - Rs. 860, SUV - Rs. 1045 Input: 120 km Expected Output: Mini - Rs. 960, Sedan - Rs. 1200, SUV - Rs. 1525 
You need to create a program to calculate the “Estimated Cost”
